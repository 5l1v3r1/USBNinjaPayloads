  This is the Code of Using magnet triggers Ninja to go online, 
  and act as a keyboard output characters.
  
  Here is an quick version. 
  -  Ninja keeps online.
  -  Once the magnet is close, it triggers immediately.
  
  void loop() 
  {
    if (digitalRead(USBDIRECTPIN) == LOW)   
    {

                                      //data line was temporarily cut off.
      NinjaKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(0); //Send HID '0' to compatibility Win7.
      NinjaKeyboard.println(F("Hello, I'm USBNinja!"));

    If you write a long string, you should use function F("") to include

    can write the string to Flash, and read it once a char to decrease 
    the available memory. 
    If you do not use this function, the string may load to RAM while
    the program start. The RAM use Bigger than 488Byte will cause
    runtime error. 
    print() will write the string without Enter Key, 
    println() will write the string with Enter Key.
