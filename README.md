A centralized place to collect USB Ninja payloads inspired by BashBunny repository.

## Contributing

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)

### Notes
- Add your script in the corresponding directory (NinjaBLESetup, NinjaKeyboard, NinjaMouse)
- Put each script in folder to keep the same structure. 
    - We do this in case a script has related files (eg. [ChangeBgrndRunMalware](https://github.com/KINGSABRI/USBNinjaPayloads/tree/master/NinjaKeyboard/ChangeBgrndRunMalware)).
- Add description in your scripts. (check the current payloads)
- Add more comments in your code.
- Use soft tabs (spaces) instead of tab (`\t`) in your code indentation
