  NinjaMouse.leftClick();       //Left click but not release.
  NinjaMouse.middleClick();     //Middle click but not release.s LEFT .
  NinjaMouse.setButtons(0);     //releas any click 
  NinjaMouse.moveX(10);  NinjaMouse.moveX(10) is jumping 10 to the RIGHT .  NinjaMouse.moveX(-10) is jumping 10 to the LEFT.
  NinjaMouse.moveY(10);  NinjaMouse.moveY(10) is jumping 10 to the DOWN .   NinjaMouse.moveY(-10) is jumping 10 to the UP .
  NinjaMouse.scroll(5);  NinjaMouse.scroll(5) is UP roller. NinjaMouse.scroll(-5) is DOWN roller.
